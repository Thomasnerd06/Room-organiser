Grouping People by Compatibility
This Python program allows you to group individuals based on how much they like each other. By collecting compatibility ratings, it forms optimized groups of a specified size.

Usage
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Thomasnerd06/Room-organiser.git

cd group-compatibility

Run the Program: Execute the following command in your terminal:

python group_people.py

Input the Number of People: Enter the total number of people you want to group.

Enter Names and Ratings: For each person, provide a compatibility rating (on a scale of 1 to 10) with others. The program will prompt you to rate your compatibility with each individual.

Optimized Groups: The program will create groups of the specified size (default: 3) based on compatibility ratings. It aims to maximize overall group compatibility.

View Results: The optimized groups will be displayed in the terminal.

Example
Suppose we have three people: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Their compatibility ratings are as follows:

Alice rates Bob: 8
Alice rates Carol: 7
Bob rates Carol: 9
The program will form the following optimized group:

Group 1: Alice, Bob, Carol
Customization
You can adjust the group size by modifying the group_size variable in the group_people.py script.
Feel free to enhance the program by adding more features or customizing the output format.
